Ver 2.0 (Dated 2nd June)
It is major release since it includes a 'URL' support.
It is basically the support available in 'Mplayer' for streaming
media. So it should support whatever 'Mplayer' supports for
streaming media.
Additionally there is a support for grabing 'YouTube' like
media, using 'movgrab' by Colum Paget (Email: colums.projects@gmail.com
Blog: http://idratherhack.blogspot.com) and its success is as good as
the support by 'Movgrab'. There is an option to search for URLs using
'Firefox'.

Also it is compiled with the new version of 'Kulina Graphics (Ver 1.2)'
It supports pasting  input boxes using Xlibs Primary and Clipboard 
buffers ( what a pain it was).

Ver 2.1 (Dated 10th June)
Included support for mp3lame; it may not be of much use now, but will
be useful for  future.
Also GUI is redesigned.

Ver 2.2 (Dated 18th June 2016)
Support for libx264 from VideoLan (I believe I am not violating their
licensing policy). This is also for future, but it is an excellent
software, the best in its domain.
Also 'Mplayer' source is moved to Ver 1.3 (the latest, hence new version
of ffmpeg also).
In case one needs to swich off video  an option is provided.
Also provided is an option to  adjust audio timing.

Ver 2.2.1 27th June 2016

Fixed bug in kgmplayer crashing when the on-screen controls
are on at end of playing. The problem was only when window
manager had problem and the work around was active, hence it took time
to identify the problem..

Ver 2.2.2 28th July 2016

Introducing Media Tool Box with plans to add more and more tools.
An mp3 tool to convert/extract audio to mp3.

Ver 2.2.3 16th Aug 2016

Introducing a tool to convert any media to 'mp4'. Rather than speed
priority is given to quality, hence process is generally time consuming.
One could have introduced an option for CD/DVD ripping also, however it is not
done considering the time for conversion. Hence one has to Rip the media and then
convert it to mp4. (In fact any format could have been introduced, but
to make it simplified only mp4 support is open.) The tool provide option
to scale or change the aspect ratio of the input file. Mp4 conversion
can reduce the size of the file considerably without compromising much on
quality.

Ver 3.0 21st Sept 2016

It could have been a version under 2.0 series, however the additions are
some what heavy, and it is released as 3.0. Mainly quite a few additions in
the tool box. Probably one can use kgmplayer for editing media files.
Now one can extract and join media files, both audio and video.
It is possible to add or change audio in media file.
Audio mixing is also prossible.
It may not be for professional work, but for hobby it may be useful.

Ver 3.1 28th Sept 2016

'kgmplayer' has a feature to stretch the video in X or Y direction 
independently (of course ignoring the aspect ratio). This enabled the
user 
to fully utilize the screen for viewing. However, this had a minor 
problem of an irritating border appearing on the screen. 
I have been trying to resolve this problem by trying various methods,
but 
all effort was unsuccessful. I almost felt that I have to live with
that, 
but to come back again and again trying to resolve. 

Today I thought of Paulo Coelho and ' The Alchemist' felt, since I am 
trying so hard I must succeed. Yes Paulo was right and I could resolve 
the problem. I once again went through the 'MPLAYER' code and could 
make a fix so the issue is resolved. Feeling very relieved.
 So a new Version for kgmplayer Ver 3.1

Ver 3.1.1 (dated 14/12/16)

A bug fix in Video Join. Audio was set undefined and it is set properly.

Ver 3.2 (dated 29th Dec 2016)

May be a new year gift to me, added an option to play all media
files in a folder. One can opt for a random selection and may put it
in a loop.

Ver 4.0 (dated 10 Jan 2017)

Option is added to select a subtitle file for playing a file. So GUI
is modified. There is also an option to select audio output device when HDMI
is connected. Earlier it was going to HDMI once there was a connection
on HDMI port. Since 'kgmplayer' was also a demo for Kulina Graphics
tools kit, GUI was bit colorfull, now it is made bit sober,

Ver 4.0.1 (dated 28 Jan 2017)

Cosmetic change in Rip GUI.
Default delay of 0.625 sec for PulseAudio is removed, since
it is not needed for some Versions od PulseAudio.


Ver 4.1.0 (dated 12th Feb 2017 )

Implemeted option to select '.sub' subtitle file. Also this can be used
to swich off subtitle by selecting /usr/share/kgmplayer/empty.sub as the
subtitle file. 

Ver 4.1.1

Attempt to include OpenSSL in ffmpeg but failed. However moved to gnutls and
with few modifications in configuration 
of ffmpeg and adding extra libraries in mplayer things became okay and working.

Ver 4.1.2

Option switch off Subtitle while playing a file.

Ver 4.2.0 Dated 02th Aug 2017

Improvement in audio conversion and audio joining. The converted audio
format was mp3 and now it is allowed to change to any supported format
and it is decided as per the output file extension. Advanced Audio
Coding (.aac) is also well supported using libfdk-aac. If it planned to
cut and join audio, it can be done smoothly by selecting cuts in
lossless formats like .wav  .flac etc. additionaly the following tools
are provided.

1. A separate tool is provided for an audio to a second media and storing
it as new audio file. Though it was possible eariler also this new tool
provide an option to select the output audio file format.
2. Another tool added is a tool to convert a stereo song to karaoke.
Success of this tool depends on the input recording. However it is
a good try.
3. A tool to insert silences in an audio. This may be useful in mixing
audio files.

Ver: 4.2.1 Dated 10th Aug 17

Added tool to make cuts in audio

Ver: 4.2.2 Dated 2nd Sept 17

Subtilte optiond for CD/DVD also.
GUI modified.

Ver: 4.3.0 Dated 29th October 2020

Added support for libx265, since it is in C++ now cmake
is required and few other corrections are made. The final linking
is forced with g++ due to this reason. 

Many tools are added to the media tool kit and plans to extend further.
