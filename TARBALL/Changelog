Ver 2.0 (Dated 2nd June)
It is major release since it includes a 'URL' support.
It is basically the support available in 'Mplayer' for streaming
media. So it should support whatever 'Mplayer' supports for
streaming media.
Additionally there is a support for grabing 'YouTube' like
media, using 'movgrab' by Colum Paget (Email: colums.projects@gmail.com
Blog: http://idratherhack.blogspot.com) and its success is as good as
the support by 'Movgrab'. There is an option to search for URLs using
'Firefox'.

Also it is compiled with the new version of 'Kulina Graphics (Ver 1.2)'
It supports pasting  input boxes using Xlibs Primary and Clipboard 
buffers ( what a pain it was).

Ver 2.1 (Dated 10th June)
Included support for mp3lame; it may not be of much use now, but will
be useful for  future.
Also GUI is redesigned.

Ver 2.2 (Dated 18th June 2016)
Support for libx264 from VideoLan (I believe I am not violating their
licensing policy). This is also for future, but it is an excellent
software, the best in its domain.
Also 'Mplayer' source is moved to Ver 1.3 (the latest, hence new version
of ffmpeg also).
In case one needs to swich off video  an option is privided.
Also provided is an option to  adjust audio timing.
